--Information from original mesh--

README.TXT for the mesh of Deep Space 9 by Joerg Gerlach
--------------------------------------------------------

Thank you for downloading this big monster file. I´m sorry about the size,
but I wasn´t able to reduce the file size any more. Every single object is
collapsed, but any more face count optimization wasn´t possible without
a decrease of smoothness. I use this mesh and all its textures on the
following system (I recommend a much better system!):

Intel Pentium 150
96 MB RAM
200 MB swap disk
WinNT4 Workstation Servicepack 5

Rendering time 640x480 (including DS9, Noise starfield background, RLF Pro Glows): 10 mins

The MAX file contains also some helper objects representing the glows used
by RealLensFlare Pro. If you don´t use RLF Pro or if you don´t have it
you can delete them without problems. If you want to use my glow settings feel
free to do so.

Usage of different textures:
----------------------------

Although this mesh looks exactly the same as the first release of my DS9 I divided
several objects into different parts for texturing. So you aren´t able to use all
my textures with the old mesh. If you want to use either the grey or the brown texture
version you only have to change the bitmap paths in MAX. The grey and brown versions
are using the same file names, so be sure to copy them into different folders. To activate
the different color versions disable one bitmap path and enable the other path using
the File/Configure Paths.../Bitmaps command in MAX. That´s all. You don´t have to
change anything on the mesh or the texture settings. It´s that simple...:-)

I hope you have that fun with the mesh I have...

Bye

Joerg
